# Abstract

This is a ressource for people coming from ArcGIS who want to do spatial stuff (Analysis, Visualization) in R. This ressource should provide some help on this journey.

Who this book is for:

- you've worked primarily with ArcGIS and would like to transition to R
- you have some experience with R
- you don't mind working with the tidyverse

# Foreword

I had long since thought about the necessity of a resource which helps ArcGIS users transition to R or Python. I had [tweeted this](https://twitter.com/NRatnaweera/status/1187759876472213504) without getting much reception, and and one point just decided to start my own resource.

I, like many, learned GIS in University using ArcGIS. It took me a considerable amount of time to learn that there are alternatives to ArcGIS, but not much longer to realize that I'm more attracted to these alternatives than to ArcGIS. When you transition from a proprietary Software like ArcGIS to FOSS, you have to relearn many of the concepts because the proprietary software usually does not adhere to common standards. 

There are already a great many spatial-R Resources out there, and I'm not planning to rewrite everything that has been written. My aim is just to provide a resource for people looking to do spatial stuff in R, but only know the ArcGIS-Term for it. This might mean that for some topics, I will simply provide a link to an existing resource.
