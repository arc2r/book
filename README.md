## Some basic text formatting rules, for keeping the document consistent.

- formatting with __bold__, in the following cases:
    - package name (e.g __sf__)
    - operation (e.g __spatial subsetting__)
    - dataset name (e.g __parking spots in the canton of Zurich)
    
- formatting with _italics_, in the following cases:
    - function name (e.g _st_buffer_)
