## Point

### Must coincide with 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Source: @esri-topology"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/topology_rules/5_0.jpg")
```

### Must be disjoint

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Source: @esri-topology"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/topology_rules/5_1.jpg")
```

### Must be covered by endpoint of

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Source: @esri-topology"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/topology_rules/6_0.jpg")
```

### Point must be covered by line

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Source: @esri-topology"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/topology_rules/6_1.jpg")
```

### Must be properly inside

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Source: @esri-topology"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/topology_rules/7_0.jpg")
```

### Must be covered by boundary of

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Source: @esri-topology"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/topology_rules/7_1.jpg")
```
