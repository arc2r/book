## Joins Toolset

//todo revise this chapter
//body nothing about this chapter is spatial, the explanation is not based on ArcGIS Tools, the joins are not intuitive (what are df1 and df2?)


In ArcGIS, joining two datasets on a common attribute is done with tools from the "Join" Toolset. Similar as described with the Selection tools in chapter \@ref(chapter-selection), a join has a temporary / floating nature and does not automatically produce an output. In `R`, joining two datasets requires is only persistent if the output is assigned to a new variable^[or piped into a new function].

In R we have two main functions for joining two datasets. On the one hand there is the base R function `merge`, on the other hand there is the `*_join` family that lie within the `dplyr` package. Since the latter family of functions are very close to how Joins are done in SQL, we will use the latter case for our examples below.

Before we begin with our examples, we have to make clear the differences among the various forms of join operations.  

- _Inner Join_ only retains rows that are matched in *both* datasets.
- _Outer Join_ retains *all* rows from both datasets.
- _Left Join_ retains all rows from the "left" dataset, _Right Join_ only those from the "right" dataset.

### Inner join

`Inner Join` in R is the most common type of join. It is an operation that returns the rows when the matching condition is fulfilled. Below we demonstrate it with an example.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
df1 <- data.frame(TeamID = c(1,4,6,11),
                  TeamName = c("new york knicks","los angeles lakers","milwaukee bucks","boston celtics"),
                  Championships = c(2,17,1,17))

df2 <- data.frame(TeamID = c(1,2,11,8),
                  TeamName = c("new york knicks","philadelphia 76ers","boston celtics","los angeles clippers"),
                  Championships = c(2,3,17,0))

df1

df2
```


```{r}
df1 %>% inner_join(df2)
```

### Outer join

`Outer join` in R using simply returns all rows from both data frames. This is very well depicted in figure \@ref(fig:joins).

```{r}
full_join(df1,df2)
```

### Left / Right join

The `left join` in R returns all records from the data frame on the left, as well as and the matched records from the one at the right.  

```{r}
left_join(df1,df2)
```  
Similarly works also the `right join`.

```{r}
right_join(df1,df2)
```
