As an ArcGIS user, you are probabbly very familiar with the two major geodata formats, raster data and vector data. In the case of vector data, we typically use *shapefiles* and geodatabases with *feature classes*. For raster data, we use *geotiff* or *ESRI GRID* files inside geodatabases. As you work with OpenSource GIS Tools and Data, you will come across a much richer ecosystem of data formats. 

@todo add some examples of geodata-formats (gpkg, sqlite, )
