## Importing vector data with `sf`

First, let's load the library `sf`. Read chapter PLACEHOLDER If you haven't installed it yet.
@todo replace placeholder

```{r}
library(sf)
```

As mentioned, `sf` is a great packge to facilitate handling vector data in R. "sf" stands for *s*imple *f*eatures, which is an open standard developed by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). You will recognize many of these feature types from your everyday GIS-experience (see figure)

To import a vector dataset into `R`, we can use the function `read_sf` as in the example below. 
@todo how does the user get access to this dataset? 
@body make this available through the packgage?
```{r}

ARE_waedenswil <- read_sf("sample_data/Entsorgung_Waedenswil/ARE_waedenswil.shp")

ARE_waedenswil
```

Much of the beauty in `sf` comes from it's simplicity: As you see from importing the shapefile, it is very much like a `data.frame`, a structure that you are probabbly know very well. In fact, it *is* a data.frame, as you can see here:

```{r}
is.data.frame(ARE_waedenswil)
```

`sf` provides methods for various generics, e.g. you can use `plot()` on the object for a simple visualisation.

```{r}
plot(ARE_waedenswil)
```
