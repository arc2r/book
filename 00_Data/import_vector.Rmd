## Importing vector data with `sf`

Most vector data that you use in everyday GIS work are what are called "simple features". Simple features are an open standard developed by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). The most common feature types are displayed in figure \@ref{fig:sf_types}.


```{r sf_types, fig.cap="The 7 (of 17) most important simple feature types. Image from https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/sf-classes.png")
```
//todo added reference with bibtex

To handle these simple features in `R`, we need the library `sf`. 

```{r}
library(sf)
```

To import a vector dataset into `R`, we can use the function `read_sf` as in the example below. 
//todo how does the user get access to this dataset? 
//body make this available through the package?
```{r}

ARE_waedenswil <- read_sf("sample_data/Entsorgung_Waedenswil/ARE_waedenswil.shp")

ARE_waedenswil
```

And you are done! The shapefile is now imported into your `R` Session and you can start working with it. Much of the beauty in `sf` comes from it's simplicity: As you see from importing the shapefile, it is very much like a `data.frame`, a structure that you are probably know very well. In fact, it *is* a data.frame, as you can see here:

```{r}
is.data.frame(ARE_waedenswil)
```

`sf` provides methods for various generics, e.g. you can use `plot()` on the object for a simple visualisation.

```{r}
plot(ARE_waedenswil)
```
