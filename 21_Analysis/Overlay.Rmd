## Overlay Toolset {#overlay-toolset}


From the docs [@esri-gptoolref]:

> The Overlay toolset contains tools to overlay multiple feature classes to combine, erase, modify, or update spatial features, resulting in a new feature class. New information is created when overlaying one set of features with another. All of the overlay operations involve joining two sets of features into a single set of features to identify spatial relationships between the input features.

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/network/Analysis_Overlay.png")
```

For this chapter, you will need the following R Packages:
```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(arc2r)
library(sf)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

### Spatial Join {#spatial-join}


@esri-gptoolref describes Spatial Join as follows:

> Joins attributes from one feature to another based on the spatial relationship. The target features and the joined attributes from the join features are written to the output feature class.


Say you have two datasets, `haltestelle_bahn` and `kantonsgebiet` as shown below. 

```{r, echo = TRUE}
data("haltestelle_bahn")
data("kantonsgebiet")


head(haltestelle_bahn)
head(kantonsgebiet)


plot(st_geometry(kantonsgebiet))
plot(haltestelle_bahn, add = TRUE, col = "blue", pch = 20)

```

For each point in `haltestelln_bahn`, we would like to know the `name` of the canton in which it is located. 
In R, the function used to join two datastes is `st_join(x,y)`. If you have to different data types (e.g. Points and Polygons) the first question you have to ask yourself is: what data type should the output be? The datatype of `x` determines what the output datatype is. 
So with the above data: Say for each point, we want to know the Name (`name`) of the "Canton" in which it lies. This means the output is a point dataset. We therefore write:

```{r, echo = TRUE}

haltestelle_bahn_join <- st_join(haltestelle_bahn,kantonsgebiet)


haltestelle_bahn_join
```

The following visualisation shows that each point has inherited the Name of the according Canton. 

```{r, echo = TRUE}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = kantonsgebiet) +
  geom_sf(data = haltestelle_bahn_join, aes(colour = NAME)) 

```

By default, the spatial relationship between `haltestellen_bahn` and `kantonsgebiet` was that of an "intersection" (this is also de default in ArcGIS). However, we can do spatial joins with other relationships as well: These relationships are commonly known as "spatial predicates".

$^2$ We haven't figured out which Spatial Predicate matches this ArcGIS term.
