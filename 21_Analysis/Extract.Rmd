For this chapter, you will need the following R Packages:
```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(arc2r)
library(sf)
library(tmap)
```

### Clip

Quite often in spatial analysis, we come across with cases where we do not want to use all the available data there is. In other words, we want to focus on a specific area of interest, which dictates the need for __clipping__ the existing dataset based on it's relationship to some other existing spatial feature. In R this operation can be easily performed using the `st_intersection` function in `sf`.
  
Let's assume in the example below that we want to clip the available dataset of all the __train stations in Switzerland__ by focusing our analysis on the cantons Zurich, St. Gallen, Thurgau and Aargau. In the following chunk we prerpare and visualize this situation.


```{r, echo = TRUE}

# Point dataset depicting the train stations locations across Switzerland
data("haltestelle_bahn")

# Dataset depicting Switzerland on canton level
data("kantonsgebiet")

kanton_filter <- filter(kantonsgebiet, name %in% c("ZÃ¼rich","St. Gallen","Thurgau","Aargau"))

plot(st_geometry(haltestelle_bahn))
plot(st_geometry(kanton_filter), col = "grey", add = TRUE,alpha = 1)

```

To clip the dataset _haltestellen_bahn_ to the extent of _kanton_filter, we can simply use the `st_intersection` function as shown below:


```{r, echo = TRUE}
haltestelle_bahn_clipped <- st_intersection(kanton_filter ,haltestelle_bahn)
```

We can now visualize the result from our operation:

```{r}
plot(st_geometry(haltestelle_bahn_clipped))
plot(st_geometry(kanton_filter), add = TRUE,alpha = 1)
```

So, ultimately, as we can see above, the `st_intersection` function creates a result where the point dataset is precisely "clipped" based on the area of interest. 
The operation above produces the same outcome as the one depicted in the figure below \@ref(fig:clip).

```{r clip, fig.cap= "Clip operation in ArcGIS pro",echo=F, out.width = "750px",fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/clipOperation.png")
```
