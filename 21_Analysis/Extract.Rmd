## Extract Toolset {#extract-toolset}


From the docs [@esri-gptoolref]:

> GIS datasets often contain more data than you need. The Extract tools let you select features and attributes in a feature class or table based on a query (SQL expression) or spatial and attribute extraction. The output features and attributes are stored in a feature class or table.

For this chapter, you will need the following R Packages:
```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(arc2r)
library(sf)
library(tmap)
```

### Clip {#clip}

Quite often in spatial analysis, we come across cases where we do not want to use all the available data there is. In other words, we want to focus on a specific area of interest, which dictates the need for __clipping__ the existing dataset based on it's relationship to some other existing spatial feature. In R this operation can be easily performed using the `st_intersection` function in `sf`.
  
Let's assume in the example below that we want to clip the available dataset of all the __train stations in Switzerland__ by focusing our analysis on the cantons Zurich, St. Gallen, Thurgau and Aargau. In the following chunk we prerpare and visualize this situation.


```{r, echo = TRUE}

# Point dataset depicting the train stations locations across Switzerland
data("haltestelle_bahn")

# Dataset depicting Switzerland on canton level
data("kantonsgebiet")

kanton_filter <- filter(kantonsgebiet, NAME %in% c("ZÃ¼rich","St. Gallen","Thurgau","Aargau"))

plot(st_geometry(haltestelle_bahn))
plot(st_geometry(kanton_filter), col = "grey", add = TRUE,alpha = 1)

```

To clip the dataset _haltestellen_bahn_ to the extent of _kanton_filter, we can simply use the `st_intersection` function as shown below:


```{r, echo = TRUE}
haltestelle_bahn_clipped <- st_intersection(kanton_filter, haltestelle_bahn)
```

We can now visualize the result from our operation:

```{r}
plot(st_geometry(haltestelle_bahn_clipped))
plot(st_geometry(kanton_filter), add = TRUE,alpha = 1)
```

So, ultimately, as we can see above, the `st_intersection` function creates a result where the point dataset is precisely "clipped" based on the area of interest. 
The operation above produces the same outcome as the one depicted in the figure below \@ref(fig:clip).

```{r clip, fig.cap= "Clip operation in ArcGIS pro",echo=F, out.width = "750px",fig.align='center', purl=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/clipOperation.png")
```



### Select {#select}

This chapter is covered in \@ref(select-by-attribute).



### Split {#split}

The split tool is used in ArcGIS to split a dataset into multiple outputs. 

When clipping the _haltestellen_ dataset in \@ref(clip) with a polygon containing multiple features (`kanton_filter`). Each point in `haltestelle_bahn_clipped` now has the attributes originating from `kanton_filter`, which we can use to split the dataset into different parts. The function `split()` (from base-R) helps us with this. It returns a list of `sf` objects, that we can each save in it's own dataset if need be.

<!--
TODO: 
- Somewhere, we might need to explain how to deal with lists and refer to apply or purrr
- what happens when we use intersection with two polygons objects. do the polygons get "cut up into pieces"?
--> 




```{r, echo = TRUE}
haltestellen_split <- split(haltestelle_bahn_clipped,haltestelle_bahn_clipped$name)

str(haltestellen_split[1:2])
```


### Split by Attributes {#split-by-attributes}
