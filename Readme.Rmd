## Geoprocessing tools

A list of ALL geoprocessing tools is documented in ESRI_Tool_names.csv, ESRI_Toolboxes.csv and ESRI_Toolsets.csv. The Tools we want to document within this book are listed in [auxiliary/tools_todo.yaml]. Read more on this topic here: [R/tools_todo.Rmd]


## Style Guide


### Inline formatting

- formatting with __bold__, in the following cases:
    - dataset name (e.g __parking spots in the canton of Zurich__)
    
- formatting with _italics_, in the following cases:
    - referring to a tool (e.g `Select By Attributes`) 
    - operation (e.g __spatial subsetting__)

    
- formatting with this `format`, in the following cases:
    - package name (e.g `sf`)
    - function name (e.g `st_buffer`)
    
### Adding notes

If you want to highlight something important, you can add [a custom block](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/custom-blocks.html) in this format: ````{block2, type = "rmdnote"}` (see example below). This block will recieve the class "rmdnote", which is specified in [css/style.css]. 

````markdown
`r ''````{block2, type='rmdnote'}
Something very important we want to convey to our readers, written in Markdown.
```
````

### Subdividing into Parts

We can add Subdivision to our document by adding the following line at the top of an Rmd-File

```
# (PART) Topology Rules {-}
```

### Citation

To cite a book or URL or whatever, add a appropriate bibtex entry to [bibliography/general.bib]. You can then cite the document using the reference \@key  or [\@key].

[bibliography/packags.bib] is generated automatically from all the packages in the DESCRIPTION of the book and the DESCRIPTION of the repo arc2r/arc2r. For this reason, ALL items in these bibtex files are added to the document, so only add entries for items we use in the book!


    
## Dependencies

To capture the various dependencies on r-Packages, we follow the following logic (see also https://github.com/arc2r/book/issues/9): 



| Priority 	| Dependency (Package Necessary to:)            	| File        	| Repo        	| Field    	| Eg.                 	|
|----------	|-----------------------------------------------	|-------------	|-------------	|----------	|---------------------	|
| 1        	| Use the **data-package**                      	| DESCRIPTION 	| arc2r/arc2r 	| Imports  	| `sf`, `raster`          	|
| 2        	| To run the code described within **the book** 	| DESCRIPTION 	| arc2r/arc2r 	| Suggests 	| `gstat`, `tmap`, `dplyr`  	|
| 3        	| Render **the book**                           	| DESCRIPTION 	| arc2r/book  	| Imports  	| `bookdown`, `rmarkdown` 	|
