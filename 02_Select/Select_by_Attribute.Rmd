## Select by Attribute

One of the selection methods you can use in ArcGIS pro to select features in a layer is to select features using an attribute query. This is performed using the **Select By Attributes** tool.

**Select By Attributes** allows you to provide a SQL query expression that is used to select features that match the selection criteria.

Let's see how this can be performed using R.

As a first step, we might want to import a shapefile. We can use the __sf package__ to work with vector data in R. Important to know is that the **rgdal package** automatically loads when sf is loaded.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
library(sf)
world <- st_read("../sample_data/spData/world.shp")
```
