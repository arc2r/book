## Select by Attribute
```{r,echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = F, message = F, tidy = T)
```


One of the popular approaches in ArcGIS pro for selecting features in a layer is by using an attribute query. The action is performed using the `Select By Attributes` tool.

`Select By Attributes` tool allows us to provide an SQL query expression to select features that match the selection criteria.

`R` on the other hand offers quite easy and straightforward options to perform similar operations. Let's examine one of them.

As a first step, we might want to import a shapefile. To do so, we can use `sf` package to work with vector data in R. Important to know is that the `rgdal` package automatically loads when sf is loaded.

In the code snippet below, we read the shapefile, which represents the __parking spots for bicycles__ within the canton of Zurich. The dataset is publicly available for download in the following link: (https://opendata.swiss/en/dataset/veloparkierungsanlagen).

```{r}
library(sf)
library(ggplot2)
parkBikes <- st_read("sample_data/Kanton_Zuerich/Veloparkierungsanlagen/OGD_VELOPARKIERANLAGEN_P.shp")
```

After importing the dataset, let's say we want to filter it by selecting only the parking spots that lie within a specific municipality (Gemeinde) in the canton of Zurich. More specifically, we will select only the parking spots within the municipality of Winterthur.
For the aforementioned operation, R offers the function `filter()`, which lies within the `dplyr` package.
This functions works as follows: `filter(dataset, condition)`

```{r}
library(dplyr)
parkBikes_winti <- filter(parkBikes,GEMEINDE == "Winterthur")
```

```{r,echo = F, fig.align='center'}
ggplot() + geom_sf(data = parkBikes) + geom_sf(data = parkBikes_winti, fill = "red", aes(color = "Bike parking spots in Winterthur")) + ggtitle("Bike parking facilities in Canton Zurich") + theme_minimal() + labs(color = " ") + theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```


The operation above produces the same outcome as the one depicted in the figure below \@ref(fig:select).

```{r select, fig.cap= "Select by Attributes in ArcGIS pro",echo=F, out.width = "500px",fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/selectAttr.png")
```
