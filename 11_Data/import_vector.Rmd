## Importing vector data with `sf` {#importing-vector-sf}

Most vector data that you use in everyday GIS work are so called "simple features". Simple features are an open standard developed by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). The most common feature types are displayed in figure \@ref(fig:sf-types).

Most functions in sf start with `st_`, which stands for "spatial type" and is the same syntax used by Postgis. Source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7234679/what-is-st-in-postgis and https://github.com/r-spatial/sf/issues/140#issuecomment-270029715

```{r sf-types, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="The 7 (of 17) most important simple feature types. Image from @geocompr", fig.align="center", out.width="100%", purl=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/sf-classes.png")
```


To handle these simple features in `R`, we need the library `sf`, and to import a vector dataset into `R`, we can use the function `read_sf` as in the example below. 
<!--
//todo how does the user get access to this dataset? 
//body make this available through the package?
-->

```{r}
library(sf)

ARE_waedenswil <- read_sf("sample_data/ARE_waedenswil.shp")

ARE_waedenswil
```

And you are done! The shapefile is now imported into your `R` Session and you can start working with it. Much of the beauty in `sf` comes from it's simplicity: As you see from importing the shapefile, it is very much like a `data.frame`, a structure that you probably know very well. In fact, it *is* a data.frame, as you can see here:

```{r}
is.data.frame(ARE_waedenswil)
```

`sf` provides methods for various generics, e.g. you can use `plot()` on the object for a simple visualisation. By default, using `plot()` on an `sf` object visualizes the geometry in small multiples, where each "facet" is colour coded based on a column in the dataset (see below). If you find this annoying (like I do), see chapter \@ref(chapter-staticmaps).

```{r}
plot(ARE_waedenswil)
```
