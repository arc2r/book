### Spatial Join


Say you have two datasets:

<!--
/ todo: replcace this with arc2r/arc2r
/  asignees: KimboGilda
--> 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(sf)
library(tidyverse)
zweitwohnung <- read_sf("sample_data/other/zweitwohnung_gemeinden.gpkg") %>%
  dplyr::filter(kanton == "Valais / Wallis") %>%
  select(NAME)

bbox <- st_bbox(zweitwohnung) %>% st_as_sfc()

points <- st_sample(bbox,500)

ggplot(zweitwohnung) + geom_sf() + geom_sf(data = points)
```

In R, the function used to join two datastes is `st_join(x,y)`. If you have to different data types (e.g. Points and Polygons) the first question you have to ask yourself is: what data type should the output be? The datatype of `x` determins what the output datatype is. 
So with the above data: Say for each point, we want to know the Name (`NAME`) of the "Geimeinde" in which it lies. This means the output is a point dataset. We therefore write:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
st_join(st_sf(points),zweitwohnung,join = st_within)
```

Note that points not located in a Gemeinde get the value `NA`. You have to specify the spatial relationship of your join method within the argument `join = `. This argument take a so called spatial predicate function. From the join_methods available in ArcGIS, here's the equivalant spatial predicate function:

| ArcGIS Term                     | R Spatial Predicate     |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Intersect                       | st_intersect            |
| Intersect 3D                    | (1)                     |
| Within a distance               | st_is_within_distance   |
| Within a distance geodesic      | ??                      |
| Within a distance 3D            | (1)                     |
| Contains                        | st_contains             |
| Completely contains             | _st_contains_properly?_ |
| Contains clementini             | ??                      |
| Within                          | st_within               |
| Completely within               |                         |
| Within clementini               | ??                      |
| Are identical to                | _st_equals?_            |
| boundry touches                 | st_touches              |
| Share a line segment            |                         |
| Have their center in            |                         |
| Closest                         | _st_nearest_feature?_   |
| Closest geodesic                | ??                      |
