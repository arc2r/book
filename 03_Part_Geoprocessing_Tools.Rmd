# (PART) Geoprocessing Tools {-}

# About this Section


As described in \@ref(difficulties), ESRI's approach to building ArcGIS is to build a tool for every situation you might encounter. This is a little different in `R`. Depending on the package, the idea is usually to provide a minimal set of functions with which the user can create their *own* tools. The creators of the package `sf` are very strict on this paradigm and are fairly vocal on it (see [this ](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf/issues/609), [this](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf/issues/702#issuecomment-381488716) and [this](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf/pull/536#issuecomment-341685846) thread).

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message=FALSE)
```

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(data.tree)
library(networkD3)

tools <- read_csv("ESRI_Tool_names.csv") %>%
  mutate(toolb = str_remove(toolb," toolbox")) %>%
  distinct(toolb, toolset, Tool)
  
toolsets <-  read_csv("ESRI_Toolsets.csv") %>%
  distinct(toolb, tool)
toolboxes <- read_csv("ESRI_Toolboxes.csv") %>%
  distinct(name)
```

We haven't found a complete overview of all the geprocessing tools in ArcGIS, but we've scraped ESRIS website and counted `r nrow(toolboxes)` Toolboxes, containing `r nrow(toolsets)` Toolsets and `r nrow(tools)` individual tools^[Note: these numbers are an approximation only, we may have made errors when scraping]. See figure \@ref(fig:toolsvis) for an interactive visualisation of all tools in ArcGIS.


```{r, toolsviz, warning=FALSE, fig.cap = "A 'diagonal Network' visualisation of all tools available in ArcGIS Pro. Hover over the blue circles to see the Name in a larger font.",fig.asp=2}
tools %>%
  filter(!is.na(Tool)) %>%
  transmute(tool = paste("GeprocessingTools",str_remove(toolb," toolbox"),toolset,Tool, sep = "/")) %>%
  as.Node(pathName = "tool") %>%
  ToListExplicit(unname = TRUE) %>%
  diagonalNetwork() #%>%
#   saveNetwork("all_tool.html")
# # 
# webshot::webshot("all_tool.html", "images/all_tools.png")
# 
# knitr::include_graphics("all_tools.png")
```


We cannot possibly cover all these tools in this book, and it wouldn't make much sense either. Once you learn the fundamental building blocks, you will be able to replicate most, if not all tools from this list. Figure \@ref(fig:toolsvis2) shows a subset of the full toolset, which we would like to cover in this book.



```{r, toolsviz2, fig.asp=2, fig.cap="A subset of tools we would like to cover in this book."}


tools_todo_df <- read_csv("auxiliary_files/tools_todo_df.csv")

tools_todo_df %>%
  transmute(tool = paste("GeoprocessingTools",toolbox, toolset, tool, sep = "/")) %>% 
  as.Node(pathName = "tool") %>%
  ToListExplicit(unname = TRUE) %>%
  diagonalNetwork()




```
