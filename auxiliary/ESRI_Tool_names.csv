Explanatory variables can take the form of fields in the attribute table of the training features, raster datasets, and distance features used to calculate proximity values for use as additional variables. In addition to validation of model performance based on the training data, predictions can be made to either features or a prediction raster.",/en/pro-app/2.7/tool-reference/spatial-statistics/an-overview-of-the-modeling-spatial-relationships-toolset.htm,Modeling Spatial Relationships,                              Modeling Spatial Relationships                          ,Spatial Statistics toolbox
