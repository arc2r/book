Relationship Classes,"Relationship classes define relationships between objects in the geodatabase. These relationships can be simple one-to-one relationships, similar to what you might create between a feature and a row in a table, or more complex one-to-many (or many-to-many) relationships between features and table rows. Some relationships specify that a given feature, row, or table is not only related to another feature but that creating, editing, or deleting one will have a specified effect on the other. These are called composite relationships, and they can be used to ensure that the links between objects in the database are maintained and up to date. Deleting a feature, such as a power pole, can trigger the deletion of other features, such as a transformer mounted on the pole or the maintenance records in a related table.",/en/pro-app/2.7/tool-reference/data-management/an-overview-of-the-relationship-classes-toolset.htm,Data Management toolbox,https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/data-management/an-overview-of-the-relationship-classes-toolset.htm
